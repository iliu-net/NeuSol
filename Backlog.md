# TODO

- [ ] Convert pikaday to input="date"
- [ ] Create a field for "equity" accounts.  Don't show this in postings/balance?
      or just show them after.  Or have the option to hide them.
- [ ] When positions are updated, an adjustment "Non-relized-value" is recorded for
      asset accounts

# Someday maybe

- The DAO for postings is not a clean encapsulation and uses SQL direct statements.
- Add unit testing using [f3 unit-testing][f3testing]
